You find yourself walking along a peaceful beach at sunset. The sky is painted with shades of orange and pink, and the waves gently lap at the shore. You feel the soft sand beneath your feet and hear the distant calls of seagulls. As you walk, you notice seashells scattered along the beach, and you bend down to pick one up. The shell is smooth and spiraled, and you hold it to your ear, listening to the faint sound of the ocean inside. The dream is calm and serene, and as you continue walking, you feel a deep sense of relaxation and contentment.
